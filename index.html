                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    Hi, I'm Anvesha Rawat, a passionate 2nd-year Computer Science student at Graphic Era Hill University.
                    I specialize in building robust and user-friendly web applications while continuously improving my
                    problem-solving skills through Data Structures and Algorithms.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a National Yoga Champion, I have developed discipline, focus, and perseverance—qualities that
                    reflect in my approach to coding and problem-solving. Alongside my academic journey, I also conduct
                    online yoga training classes, combining my passion for health and technology.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I love developing efficient and scalable solutions that solve real-world problems. My interests
                    span full-stack development, AI/ML, and competitive programming. Currently, I'm working on projects
                    involving web development and machine learning, exploring the intersection of software engineering
                    and intelligent systems.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I thrive on learning new technologies and staying up-to-date with industry trends. Whether it's
                    optimizing algorithms, creating seamless user experiences, or contributing to open-source projects,
                    I'm always eager to push my limits and grow as a developer.

                    <p>
                        A:"I had a lot of trouble in my early days of programming. I frequently got stuck and became frustrated when I saw how quickly others solved problems. Instead of giving up, I began practicing every day with the goal of strengthening my ability to solve problems and master fundamental ideas.  I discovered that the secret to progress is constant work and concentrated practice. I came to see that by breaking down problems into smaller ones and examining my errors, I can overcome them. I learned from this experience that I can learn anything if I put in the necessary effort and dedication."

                        A:"Public speaking is one of my weaknesses; I sometimes feel nervous when giving presentations in front of large audiences. I've been practicing speaking frequently to get better. I also record myself describing technical ideas, then watch the videos to see where I can do better. In order to progressively boost my confidence, I also offer to present in small group projects. I am aware that with practice and experience, I can improve my public speaking abilities.
