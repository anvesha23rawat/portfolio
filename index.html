                <p>
                    Hi, I’m Anvesha Rawat, a passionate 2nd-year Computer Science student at Graphic Era Hill University.
                    I specialize in building robust and user-friendly web applications while continuously improving my
                    problem-solving skills through Data Structures and Algorithms.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a National Yoga Champion, I have developed discipline, focus, and perseverance—qualities that
                    reflect in my approach to coding and problem-solving. Alongside my academic journey, I also conduct
                    online yoga training classes, combining my passion for health and technology.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I love developing efficient and scalable solutions that solve real-world problems. My interests
                    span full-stack development, AI/ML, and competitive programming. Currently, I’m working on projects
                    involving web development and machine learning, exploring the intersection of software engineering
                    and intelligent systems.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I thrive on learning new technologies and staying up-to-date with industry trends. Whether it's
                    optimizing algorithms, creating seamless user experiences, or contributing to open-source projects,
                    I’m always eager to push my limits and grow as a developer.

                        A:I have a few interests beyond college that help me stay balanced.

                        A:"I have a strong interest in machine learning and artificial intelligence. I find it interesting that we can teach machines to learn and make decisions.
